### Project Description:
In assignment 4, we created an application that calculated the user's 
monthly expenses and displayed the percentages of money used in each category
for a given month. We did this by applying what we learned about handling 
variables, building expressions, using certain methods such as getElementById, 
and using event handlers.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Variables are used to store data in memory, although the value of the
variable can change throughout the script. In a way, it serves as a container
for values.

2. The getElementById method is a method of the document object that allows 
for the retrieval of the informtation about an element. This method can also
be used to change the values assigned to the element's attributes.

3. An event handler is the name for code that executes in response to the
occurance of an event, which is a circumstance that is monitored by Javascript.
The code for an event handler can be specified as an attribute of the element
that incepts the event.
